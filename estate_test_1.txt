UppercaseSeven#7777: *one of the Commanders enters my room*
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Admiral Warren, our scanners are detecting unusual activity out in the garden
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Alright then, get me my Sniper Rifle if you would.
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Yes, sir.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *a few minutes pass, and the commander is back*
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Admiral, your rifle.
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Thank you, I'll be heading to one of the sniper points now.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: ( :GWfroggyZoomeyes: )
UppercaseSeven#7777: *I arrive at the window*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Alright, let's see what's going on over here.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Activates the Engineer's Eye, and spots another airship, along with some people in the garden.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He also sees some people by the dining room window.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Crap, they know I'm here.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Huh, maybe not.
UppercaseSeven#7777: I think he said something about an object.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Definitely not my sniper dot.
UppercaseSeven#7777: The hell are they doing?
UppercaseSeven#7777: They look like idiots.
UppercaseSeven#7777: They might be evacuating out that airship, now's my chance.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Oh.
UppercaseSeven#7777: It was a fucking corgi.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Great.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Commander, send some drones down there to plant some bombs on the airship.
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Sir, explosives are in place.
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Perfect, let's play the waiting game now.
agentfancypants#0438: ((which airship is it? is it mine?? :zoomyeyes: ))
UppercaseSeven#7777: (It's dbug's)
agentfancypants#0438: ((ok))
Deleted User#0000: *dbug's airship passes alex's close enough to overhear them on its takeoff*
Deleted User#0000: *shouting* OI!
Deleted User#0000: *dbug's PA system could be heard* Sent out the bomb crews, we have a bomb on board!
Spring Bun •x•#9049: ( :zoomyeyes: )
UppercaseSeven#7777: Piss, we're too close to set off them bombs.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Plan B.
Deleted User#0000: *a small boarding party consisting of 25 top of the line and high quality corgis is dispatched onto the airship*
Deleted User#0000: *meanwhile, the bombs are dislodged from the hull and chucked back into alex's ship*
UppercaseSeven#7777: You call that a boarding? WATCH THIS!
Deleted User#0000: oh really? *hundreds of elite corgis flood onto the deck*
Deleted User#0000: just watch me*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *dives his airship straight into the ground, causing an explosion*
Deleted User#0000: :|
Deleted User#0000: *the corgis on his ship at the moment jet off before the crash and back to Dbug's ship*
Deleted User#0000: *dbug sneaks on and plants am MOARCB (mother of all remote control bombs) on alex's ship*
Deleted User#0000: *dbug escapes*
Deleted User#0000: ***BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM***
blastogypsy#0064: *An artillery shell tears through the commotion and embeds itself in the ground. It says "Love, Lucy" on it*
Deleted User#0000: :|
UppercaseSeven#7777: (Didn't I self destruct the airship?)
Deleted User#0000: *dbug is still in the air, he makes a bee-line to the shell's source*
UppercaseSeven#7777: (By flying it into the ground?)
Deleted User#0000: (yes but i snuck into the wreck and double oof'd it just to be sure)
Deleted User#0000: *dbug still bolts to the source of the artillery shell*
Deleted User#0000: (which channel)
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Just before the impact, Alex activated his cloaking device and parachuted off.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The commander managed to escape by doing the same*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Once they land, Alexander fires a rocket from his rocket launcher into the general direction of the airship*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Damnit, I missed, let me try again
UppercaseSeven#7777: Damn it, I missed again, one more try
UppercaseSeven#7777: *climbs a tree for a better view of the estate and fires*
UppercaseSeven#7777: ... I give up.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Hold on, let me try my rifle
Exhausted Bear#0573: *punches Alex knocking him out*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The commander takes notice of this and activates the cloaking device, concealing him and Alex*
Exhausted Bear#0573: (Dude I teleported right next to you)
UppercaseSeven#7777: (Yeah, the commander survived too.)
UppercaseSeven#7777: (The dude has fast reflexes)
Exhausted Bear#0573: *teleports dropping Alex in the dining room unconscious and teleports back*
Exhausted Bear#0573: Hello commander.
Exhausted Bear#0573: You’ve bombarded my home and had a sniper shoot at me
UppercaseSeven#7777: (The dude has a cloaking device)
Exhausted Bear#0573: (I can teleport)
Exhausted Bear#0573: *pulls her daggers out they charge with lightning*
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Alright then, but...
Exhausted Bear#0573: You’re blue?
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The commander plays harsh static from the feed, rudely waking Alex up.* (or is that not how it works)
Exhausted Bear#0573: (He’s like unconscious)
Exhausted Bear#0573: (Is the commander blue?)
UppercaseSeven#7777: Is there a reason I should be telling you?
Exhausted Bear#0573: Because if you are then we are allies and you are out of line soldier
Exhausted Bear#0573: I am Cubbies, minister of foreign affairs for purple
Exhausted Bear#0573: Explain yourself soldier
UppercaseSeven#7777: I do not work for the blue army, I decided to work for Alex.
Exhausted Bear#0573: And Alex is my grandson
UppercaseSeven#7777: And so?
Exhausted Bear#0573: And so why are you attacking my estate
UppercaseSeven#7777: Alex said some guy in a green cloak paid him well to do it.
agentfancypants#0438: ((!!!!!!!!!!))
Exhausted Bear#0573: Dear god.
agentfancypants#0438: ((*!!!!!*))
Spring Bun •x•#9049: (**!!!!!!**)
UppercaseSeven#7777: What, is the "Green Cloak Terrorist" a thing or something?
Exhausted Bear#0573: Not exactly but it’s a larger issue
UppercaseSeven#7777: (this might fit better in #forest, since that's where he crash landed)
Exhausted Bear#0573: (Ok)

UppercaseSeven#7777: (This ship blew up a while ago)
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: Ha, this brings back memories.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He walks to the steering panel.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Ready, set, GO!
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The airship takes off with no difficulty.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: WHOO! THIS IS STILL FUCKING AWESOME!
UppercaseSeven#7777: Well then, I should test out the new guns.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He spots a random pidgeon.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He activates the machine guns, taking down the pigeon with the first few shots.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: PIDGEON DOWN, MY COMRADES!
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He spots a lone tree sitting in the middle of the plains.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He now activates the rocket launchers, obliterating the tree when it hits.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: HAHA! THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH FUN FOR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He continues with his joyride, killing pigeons and blowing up trees.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *After he's done, he docks at the airship pads.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Man, that was WAY too much fun.
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: (for the record, here's what my airship looks like)
agentfancypants#0438: (nice)
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alexander boards the airship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Last night's little joyride was fun as hell, I'll do it again.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The airship flies up, with Alexander at the control center.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He once again slaughters pigeons with the machine guns and blows up trees with the rockets.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Alright, that's enough for today.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He flies his airship back to the landing pad*
Tetsu44#2859: *lightning strikes it*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Ah piss, Lightning?
UppercaseSeven#7777: It isn't even storming, the hell is that possible?
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He quickly rushes to repair the damage.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *It's minor damage to the deck, though an inconvenience, certainly unexpected.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *The airship is on autopilot, meaning that it's returning to dock at the airship pads still.*
Tetsu44#2859: *it is struck again*
Exhausted Bear#0573: *a small fire starts*
UppercaseSeven#7777: You know what? Fuck this defiance of logic.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He puts out the small fire, and leaves the ship to autopilot back to the dock as he jumps off with a parachute.*
agentfancypants#0438: ((Where you landing, Agent wants to meet you there))
agentfancypants#0438: *comes here*
agentfancypants#0438: *puts Alex down* Well I suppose it doesn’t much matter, but I will suggest staying the blazes away from the outdoors on full moons in the future.
agentfancypants#0438: Okay, gotta go, good to see you sorry bye
agentfancypants#0438: *runs off*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Thanks.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He pulls out two metal rods and uses them as very uncomfortable crutches.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He moves down to the bottom deck.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He grabs supplies and begins work on repairing his leg.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: This is too slow.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He pulls out a bottle of JWD-4832*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He drinks it*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Within the next minute, his leg is repaired.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He also manages to repair the damage from the lightning strikes with ease before the effects wear off.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Christ, it’s like alcohol, but it actually helps you be productive!
UppercaseSeven#7777: I would go out for another joyride, but I actually have some sense in me.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He leaves the airship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He returns to the airship, still laughing,*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He spends the night watching tv.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He notices the smoke coming from the Estate.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He contemplates whether or not to help out.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Eventually, he decides to wait a bit before helping.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He grabs the lava extinguisher.*
agentfancypants#0438: ((the what!?))
UppercaseSeven#7777: (The lava extinguisher, you don’t have one?)
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He also grabs the backup egg.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He exits the airship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He comes back, and relaxes in the lower deck, going back to watching his tv show.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He decides to take off, so he can still watch the show, but it’s like x10 cooler since he’s 100 meters above ground.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Hmm, where did those guys go?
UppercaseSeven#7777: Most likely the forest.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He sets the ship to autopilot to fly to the forest.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: I need some music.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He plays * Despacito* at full volume.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Wrong song.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He quickly changes the song to the Spongebob intro song.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Now THIS is real music.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He turns the volume back up to full.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He spots the villa.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Ah, that’s there they probably went.
UppercaseSeven#7777: How should I signal them that it’s ok to come out?
UppercaseSeven#7777: Rockets and machine guns would be too violent.
Tetsu44#2859: ((Ya think?))
agentfancypants#0438: ((how about no))
UppercaseSeven#7777: Maybe I could try out my new firework battery.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Yeah, that could work.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He moves out the the top deck and deploys the battery.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He powers on the battery, sending out a slew of fireworks.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: On second though, maybe explosions aren’t the best.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Well, what else do I do?
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He powers off the battery.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: HEY, I’VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH OUT TO YOU FOR A WHILE, CAN YOU FUCKING COME OUT ALREADY?
UppercaseSeven#7777: ... nope. No response.
UppercaseSeven#7777: I’ll just go down there myself.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He renters the airship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: wow, that bitch is rude.
UppercaseSeven#7777: I’m just gonna head back, I don’t really care anymore.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He pilots the airship back to the estate.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He docks and spends the night watching tv in his ship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: ...Huh. I’m a bit hungry.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He leaves the airship for the dining room.*
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He's currently reading a book from his bookshelf titled "RED: A brief history."*
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alexander walks onto the airship.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: I'm supposed to meet Crestoph in Nerdsenburg for a chat. Let's see how stealthy this thing is.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *After a bit of procrastinating, Alexander finally starts the ship up and sets it to autopilot.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alexander comes to a stop over Nunnington Fort.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He lowers down his ladder.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *After like an hour, Crestoph finally boards.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Took you long enough.
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Alright, what have you got down?
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Well, we have a good location to take out Rjdio. He should be dead in around 4 days.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: ( :GWfroggyZoomeyes: )
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Perfect, there any problems?
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Only the 20 or so guards he's with.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alexander tosses Crestoph one of his cloaking devices.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Crestoph has awful hand-eye coordination, so it hits him in the face.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: Ow, the hell was that for?
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Pick it up, it's a cloaking device.
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: You expect us to work with only one?
UppercaseSeven#7777: A: Yes.
UppercaseSeven#7777: C: ...Fine. See you later.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Crestoph jumps off the ship. A faint "Ow, my leg!" can be heard.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alexander sets the airship back to autopilot to fly back to the Estate.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *On the trip back, Alexander considers adding a mini-fridge to the airship so he can eat sandwiches on the go.*

UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex boards his ship, and starts it up.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He flies it up to a fairly tall height, and moves out to the deck.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: I've never gotten a chance to take in a view on these rides.
UppercaseSeven#7777: It would be nice to... just... get lost in my own thoughts up here for a bit.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He closes his eyes, and daydreams for a bit.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex opens his eyes again, and shakes off the memories.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Some things... may just be best left in the past.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He goes back inside the ship, and lands it at the airship pad.*
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex hops onto his ship and sets course to Domus Imperii for clothes shopping.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Let's see... should be about 300 meters away...
UppercaseSeven#7777: 100 more meters, time to use this.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He attaches his cloaking device to his ship, and it turns invisible, including him and everything else inside.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He "parks" the ship 50 meters or so about a store called "Stereotypical Big Clothes Store".*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He jumps off the ship, onto the clothes store roof.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: (domus imperii is already taken up so i'll just use this channel)
UppercaseSeven#7777: *His shoes make him land with no issues.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Wow, I should have made these earlier.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He enters the shop from the top, because he's too lazy to drop down from the top. Also the fact that someone falling off a roof of a big store would definitely garner some attention.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He climbs through a vent, and ends up in a small storage area with a guard in it.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Luckily, not only is the guard deaf, he's looking in the opposite direction.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He sneaks up behind the man, and punches him in the back of the head. He falls to the ground, knocked out.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He exits through the doors, now in the main store and inconspicuous.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Wait a second, why don't I just steal from the storage?
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He enters back through the door.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He searches through the storage boxes and finds a nice suit.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He also steals an entire box of blue shorts and shirts.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He exits back through the surprisingly spacious vents.*
Ritz#7616: ( :GWfroggyZoomeyes: )
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He reaches the roof and jumps back up to his invisible ship, with help from the extreme force generated from the 50 meter fall.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He sets the clothes box down below deck, and flies back to the estate. He gets 50 meters away before deactivating the cloaking device.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He spends the entire trip back trying on the new clothes.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He goes back on deck and hooks his bagpipe up to giant speakers.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He then plays his bagpipes. Extremely badly.*
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex decides to go flying for some fresh air.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He very clearly does not care for the laws of physics, and somehow manages to do barrel rolls and flips.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *While one of his flips was in progress, one of the books from the shelves landed on the "fire rockets" button. To be honest, it's a miracle it didn't happen sooner.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Whoops, let's hope nobody saw that.
UppercaseSeven#7777: *After a long while, the rockets finally fire.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Ah, there they are.
UppercaseSeven#7777: Wait, are those fireworks?
UppercaseSeven#7777: How did I manage to load fireworks into the rockets chamber?
UppercaseSeven#7777: *In the cockpit, a warning goes off saying that the airship is out of fuel. It actually was more like "You fool, remember to refuel, cause you're probably going to die now."*
UppercaseSeven#7777: Not this agai-
UppercaseSeven#7777: *He's interrupted by the ship going into a near vertical dive.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex is dumb, but he was smart enough to at least install a parachute to slow the ship's descent.*
UppercaseSeven#7777: *This was enough to make the only casualties of this incident an unlucky pigeon that got hit on the way down.*
alex’s-airship
UppercaseSeven#7777: *Alex hops in and pilots himself back to the estate.*

Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: It is still *bad.* I do not know how to express this to you!
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: fine, yes, I am glad everyone is alive, and safe, but that man could have had a family of his own, a life.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: why does that matter? Mother would have killed them anyway!
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: We just helped her out!

Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *frustrated* Why are you so vauge?

Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: Funny... I feel like... before... this was different, with the voices in my head.

Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *annoyed* I may not have empathy, but part of my job is to have your well being- well, so.

Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: I'm going to try- *screws up his face distastefully* one of those. Hug things. Because it helps you, for some wild reason. So do it before I change my mind.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *chuckles softly* You are kidding me.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *stony faced* You have five more seconds before I change my mind.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *stands up, walking over*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *most awkward attempt at a hug in existence*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *hug*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: eghhhhok that's enough
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *backs off quickly, pushing Cal away from him*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: Thank you, Alaric. *smiles*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *looks disgusted* Whatever, sure.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *quiet sigh, thoughts returning to last night*

Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: Why is my face so hot
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *snerkily* Kate thinks your face is hot
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: N-No
Exhausted Bear#0573: (Omg nooooo)

Spring Bun •x•#9049: *Alaric is lying on the floor, flipping a coin absentmindedly while thinking. Cal is also lying on the floor, daydreaming idly as he reads.*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: So Cal, I've been wondering.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: Hmm.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: 53 is like. The trauma part of Mother, right.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: Mhm.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: The thing is, I've looked through your memories, and luckily for you, it seems you do not have a split personality disorder. It was only just you.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: yes...?
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *calmly flipping the coin* So what am I?
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *pauses*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: You are my hunger side.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: Yeah, but I'm a little bit more than that. I'm not a carbon copy of you.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *looking confused*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: I... Do not know?
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: Come on, Cal. You're a smart boy. You can figure it out.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: If you already know, why are you asking me?
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: I just want to confirm my theory.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *thinks, confused*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: I honestly do not understand what you mean.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *holds coin in between his fingers* Well, what I'm starting to think is. To put this simply, that I'm everything you're afraid of becoming.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *opens mouth, then closes it*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: Apathetic, violent, crazy. It makes perfect sense when you think about it.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: The first time I remember existing, you were scared.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: Well, other than being a general bundle of "eat I'm hungry" and survival instinct, I guess.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: I... Did not intend to do that....
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *waves hand, smiling* It's fine.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: You seem happy about it.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: *his smile gets a little bigger* I mean, you get scared pretty often, in my experience. More opportunities for me.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *frowns*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: And besides, it means you don't hate me, not really. You're just afraid of me.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: I would not say that. You still irritate me frequently.
Spring Bun •x•#9049: A: Heh. *returns to flipping coin*
Spring Bun •x•#9049: C: *thinking*
