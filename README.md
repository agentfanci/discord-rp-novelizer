# discord-rp-novelizer
A Python program for taking text files generated from rp servers and organizing them.

__Basic Function Goals__
  - Be able to sort messages by date and time or channel
  - Create chronological list of messages, regardless of channel
  
__More Complex Function Goals__
  - Organize messages by scene
  - Place scenes in correct chronological order even when switching channels or simultaneous
  - Keep simultaneous scenes separate and not interspersed with one another
  - Create corpuses of particular messages for natural language analysis- sort by author, time of day, etc
  
__Future Possibilities__
  - Create a GUI or other interface
  - Authorship and other analysis to determine characters in scenes
  - Expand capabilities past Discord exclusively
  
Current intention is to use text files generated by [DiscordChatExporter by Tyrrz](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter).
