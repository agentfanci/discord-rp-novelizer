# Discord RP Novelizer 0.1
#all right, here we are, gonna... make a file woo
#and. connect it to github somehow we'll see how that g
# oki so this shall be a planning place that is less public
# what do I need to do first before I can do like, anything?
# Class structure, and classes themselves
# Message class: holds a message. Has date & time, sender, channel, and content. Is comparable by date and time
# Novelizer/box? class: has a big bin of messages and can spit them out in various ways
# Scene class: holds a group of messages from the same channel, and has spots for a "next" and "previous" scenes

#Also I gotta figure out how to read files in because idk my dudes
# but it's important to do, heh
# I should research that
# also probably decide what kind of files I'll be looking for- redownloading everything as CSVs shouldn't actually be too bad
#should check how much data it actually is, about, and if having. three versions of it. is all that bad actually. 

#oki am getting things as csvs as I type now so
#...howmst to get them to a program?
File_object.readlines() sounds like what I want!
will return a list of strings, each line is a string! Sounds great

now, how to break down a csv?
also what does it do if the content contains newlines that's. an important point but

or a loop of readline(), I think, yes
